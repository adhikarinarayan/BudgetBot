## Some examples of answers from Budgetbot


## Future work
Although Budgetbot's responses are good, we can improve it further.
1. Instead of GooglePalm, we can use other LLMs like LLama2,Mistral 7B etc.
2. We can add more documents related to budget to improve the semantic search results.
3. Instead of FAISS, other vector databases like pincone can be utilized for this task.
